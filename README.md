## What This Plugin Does

This plugin simply extracts all lightbulbs, outlets and blinds currently in use by the IKEA Tr√•dfri
Gateway and exposes them to HomeKit and you have the ability to turn the
devices on or off. And, of course, you may change the device names and
group them into rooms on your iPhone or iPad.

The following IKEA devices are supported

- Standard white bulbs
- RGB bulbs
- Warm white bulbs with temperature control
- Outlets
- Blinds

After this, start **homebridge**, scan the presented code with your iPhone, and hopefully
you will se all you IKEA lightbulbs in your iPhone/iPad Home app.
